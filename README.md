# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions (they will probably mostly be written in python) for the project euler (https://projecteuler.net/).

The file projecteuler.py contains some functions that may be useful for more than one problem, such as testing whether a number is prime, its prime factors, its divisors and so on.
